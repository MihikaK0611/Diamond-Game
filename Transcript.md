# Diamond Game

Owner: Vrinda Singhal

Person:

- The Diamond Bidding Game is a two or three-player trick-taking card game with elements of bidding and bluffing. Here's a breakdown of the rules, gameplay, and strategies:

Components:

Deck: A standard deck of cards (52 cards) is used, but only cards from Spades, Hearts, and Clubs are included (removing Diamonds).
Players: Two or three players compete to win the most points.
Bidding Cards: Each player has a separate suit assigned at the beginning (e.g., Spades for player 1, Hearts for player 2). Throughout the game, players secretly bid using cards from their assigned [suit.NO](http://suit.no/) shuffling among the cards of different suits, just random complete whole suit is assigned to every player.

Gameplay:

Dealing: Separate suits are given to each player, no shuffling among cards of different suits.
Bidding Rounds: There are 13 rounds, one for each Diamond card (Ace to 2, with Ace being the highest value).
In each round, a Diamond card is revealed. This card determines the points awarded to the winner of the round. Diamonf cards coming for bid in a order Ace(14 points) being highest then King and so on till 2 being lowest.
Players secretly bid using a single card from their assigned suit.
while bidding player don't now each other cards but once they bid for the particular diamond card of that particular round and scores are given then they reveal their bid simultaneously before next round.
Bids are revealed simultaneously.
The player who bids the highest card value in their assigned suit wins the round and collects the points associated with the revealed Diamond card.
Used cards are tracked to prevent reuse in future bids. Once a player use a specific card from his/her assigned suit then it can't reuse that card again.
In case of a tie (both players bid the same card value), points are shared between players.
Winning:

The player with the highest score at the end of all 13 rounds wins the game.
Points are accumulated by winning the bidding rounds and collecting the corresponding Diamond card values.
Strategies:

Tracking Used Cards: Keeping track of the cards your opponent has already used in their bids can help you predict their remaining high-value cards and adjust your own strategy.
Bluffing with Mid-Range Cards: In early rounds, especially when bidding for high-value diamonds, you can consider using a mid-range card as a bluff if you suspect your opponent might overbid with a higher card they'd like to save for later.
Prioritizing High-Value Diamonds: Since the point value of the diamond card itself determines the score, it's often strategic to prioritize winning bids for the higher-value diamonds (Ace, King, Queen) in the earlier rounds. This secures a larger point advantage early on.
Calculated Risks for Lower Diamonds: For lower-value diamonds, you might take calculated risks with your bids. If you suspect your opponent doesn't have many high-value cards left, you might use a lower card to secure the win.
Adapting to Your Opponent: Observing your opponent's bidding patterns and the cards they haven't used can help you refine your strategy throughout the game.
Additional Notes:

The game relies on a combination of strategy and luck, especially when dealing with random card draws and opponent bids.
The Diamond Bidding Game can be played with variations in terms of the number of players, the point values associated with Diamonds, and the strategic elements involved.
This explanation covers the core aspects of the Diamond Bidding Game. You can now provide Python code for this game.

ChatGPT:

- Certainly! Here's a Python implementation of the Diamond Bidding Game for two players. It includes functionalities such as dealing cards, bidding, revealing bids, tracking used cards, determining winners, and calculating scores.

```python
import random

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, assigned_suit):
        self.name = name
        self.assigned_suit = assigned_suit
        self.hand = []

    def bid(self):
        print(f"{self.name}, it's your turn to bid.")
        print(f"Your hand: {self.hand}")
        while True:
            try:
                bid_value = int(input("Enter the value of the card you want to bid: "))
                if bid_value < 2 or bid_value > 14 or bid_value not in [card[0] for card in self.hand]:
                    raise ValueError("Invalid bid. Choose a card value from your hand.")
                break
            except ValueError as e:
                print(e)
        return bid_value

def deal_cards():
    deck = [(value, suit) for value in range(2, 15) for suit in ['Spades', 'Hearts', 'Clubs']]
    random.shuffle(deck)
    player1_hand = [card for card in deck if card[1] == 'Spades']
    player2_hand = [card for card in deck if card[1] == 'Hearts']
    return player1_hand, player2_hand

def reveal_bid(player1, player2, round_num):
    print(f"Round {round_num}: Revealing bids...")
    print(f"{player1.name} bids {player1_bid}, {player2.name} bids {player2_bid}.")
    return max(player1_bid, player2_bid)

def determine_winner(player1_bid, player2_bid):
    if player1_bid > player2_bid:
        return player1
    elif player2_bid > player1_bid:
        return player2
    else:
        return None  # Tie

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Diamond Bidding Game!")
    player1 = Player("Player 1", "Spades")
    player2 = Player("Player 2", "Hearts")
    player1.hand, player2.hand = deal_cards()
    score_player1 = 0
    score_player2 = 0

    for round_num in range(1, 14):
        player1_bid = player1.bid()
        player2_bid = player2.bid()
        winner_bid = reveal_bid(player1, player2, round_num)
        winner = determine_winner(player1_bid, player2_bid)
        if winner:
            if winner == player1:
                score_player1 += winner_bid
            else:
                score_player2 += winner_bid
        else:
            score_player1 += winner_bid // 2
            score_player2 += winner_bid // 2

    print("Game over! Final scores:")
    print(f"{player1.name}: {score_player1} points")
    print(f"{player2.name}: {score_player2} points")
    if score_player1 > score_player2:
        print(f"{player1.name} wins!")
    elif score_player2 > score_player1:
        print(f"{player2.name} wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

You can run this code in a Python environment to play the Diamond Bidding Game with two players. The players will bid for each round based on their assigned suit and accumulate points based on the values of the revealed Diamond cards.

Person:

ChatGPT:

- Certainly! Here's the complete code for the Diamond Bidding Game with two players, including the missing parts like tracking used cards and adjusting the bidding options accordingly:

```python
import random

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, assigned_suit):
        self.name = name
        self.assigned_suit = assigned_suit

                    raise ValueError("Invalid bid. Choose a card value from your hand.")
                break
            except ValueError as e:
                print(e)
        used_cards.append((bid_value, self.assigned_suit))
        return bid_value

def deal_cards():

    random.shuffle(deck)
    player1_hand = [card for card in deck if card[1] == 'Spades']
    player2_hand = [card for card in deck if card[1] == 'Hearts']
    return player1_hand, player2_hand

def reveal_bid(player1, player2, round_num):

    print(f"{player1.name} bids {player1_bid}, {player2.name} bids {player2_bid}.")
    return max(player1_bid, player2_bid)

def determine_winner(player1_bid, player2_bid):
    if player1_bid > player2_bid:
        return player1
    elif player2_bid > player1_bid:

    player1.hand, player2.hand = deal_cards()
    score_player1 = 0
    score_player2 = 0
    used_cards = []

    for round_num in range(1, 14):
        player1_bid = player1.bid(used_cards)
        player2_bid = player2.bid(used_cards)
        winner_bid = reveal_bid(player1, player2, round_num)

        if winner:
            if winner == player1:
                score_player1 += winner_bid
            else:
                score_player2 += winner_bid
        else:
            score_player1 += winner_bid // 2
            score_player2 += winner_bid // 2

    print("Game over! Final scores:")
    print(f"{player1.name}: {score_player1} points")

    elif score_player2 > score_player1:
        print(f"{player2.name} wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

In this updated code, the `bid` method of the `Player` class now takes a list of used cards as a parameter. This list keeps track of which cards have been used in previous bids, ensuring that players cannot reuse the same card. The `available_cards` variable in the `bid` method filters out the cards that have already been used, presenting the player with only the remaining available cards to bid.

Person:

- complete after this:

if **name** == "**main**":
main()

ChatGPT:

- Certainly! Here's the completion of the code after the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

This line ensures that the `main()` function is executed only if the script is run directly, not if it's imported as a module into another script. When you run this code, it will start the Diamond Bidding Game for two players, deal cards, and handle the bidding rounds until the end of the game. The final scores and the winner will be displayed at the end of the game.

NameError: name 'player1_bid' is not defined

ChatGPT:

- I see the issue. It seems like there's a scope problem with the `player1_bid` and `player2_bid` variables used in the `reveal_bid` function. They are defined within the `main` function and are not accessible directly within `reveal_bid`. To fix this, we can pass these bid values as parameters to the `reveal_bid` function. Let me make that adjustment for you:

```python
import random

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, assigned_suit):
        self.name = name
        self.assigned_suit = assigned_suit
        self.hand = []

    def bid(self, used_cards):
        print(f"{self.name}, it's your turn to bid.")
        available_cards = [card for card in self.hand if card not in used_cards]
        print(f"Your hand: {available_cards}")
        while True:
            try:
                bid_value = int(input("Enter the value of the card you want to bid: "))
                if bid_value < 2 or bid_value > 14 or bid_value not in [card[0] for card in available_cards]:
                    raise ValueError("Invalid bid. Choose a card value from your hand.")
                break
            except ValueError as e:
                print(e)
        used_cards.append((bid_value, self.assigned_suit))
        return bid_value

def deal_cards():
    deck = [(value, suit) for value in range(2, 15) for suit in ['Spades', 'Hearts', 'Clubs']]
    random.shuffle(deck)
    player1_hand = [card for card in deck if card[1] == 'Spades']
    player2_hand = [card for card in deck if card[1] == 'Hearts']
    return player1_hand, player2_hand

def reveal_bid(player1, player2, round_num, player1_bid, player2_bid):
    print(f"Round {round_num}: Revealing bids...")
    print(f"{player1.name} bids {player1_bid}, {player2.name} bids {player2_bid}.")
    return max(player1_bid, player2_bid)

def determine_winner(player1_bid, player2_bid):
    if player1_bid > player2_bid:
        return player1
    elif player2_bid > player1_bid:
        return player2
    else:
        return None  # Tie

def main():
    print("Welcome to the Diamond Bidding Game!")
    player1 = Player("Player 1", "Spades")
    player2 = Player("Player 2", "Hearts")
    player1.hand, player2.hand = deal_cards()
    score_player1 = 0
    score_player2 = 0
    used_cards = []

    for round_num in range(1, 14):
        player1_bid = player1.bid(used_cards)
        player2_bid = player2.bid(used_cards)
        winner_bid = reveal_bid(player1, player2, round_num, player1_bid, player2_bid)
        winner = determine_winner(player1_bid, player2_bid)
        if winner:
            if winner == player1:
                score_player1 += winner_bid
            else:
                score_player2 += winner_bid
        else:
            score_player1 += winner_bid // 2
            score_player2 += winner_bid // 2

    print("Game over! Final scores:")
    print(f"{player1.name}: {score_player1} points")
    print(f"{player2.name}: {score_player2} points")
    if score_player1 > score_player2:
        print(f"{player1.name} wins!")
    elif score_player2 > score_player1:
        print(f"{player2.name} wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Now, the `player1_bid` and `player2_bid` values are passed as arguments to the `reveal_bid` function, allowing it to access and display these values correctly.

Person:

- Welcome to the Diamond Bidding Game!
Player 1, it's your turn to bid.

NameError: name 'player2' is not defined

this is the error

ChatGPT:

- I see the issue. The error occurs because the `player2` variable is referenced in the `determine_winner` function without being passed as an argument. To fix this, we need to modify the `determine_winner` function to accept `player1` and `player2` as arguments. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import random

    def __init__(self, name, assigned_suit):
        self.name = name

                    raise ValueError("Invalid bid. Choose a card value from your hand.")
                break
            except ValueError as e:

    return max(player1_bid, player2_bid)

def determine_winner(player1_bid, player2_bid, player1, player2):
    if player1_bid > player2_bid:
        return player1
    elif player2_bid > player1_bid:

    used_cards = []

    for round_num in range(1, 14):
        player1_bid = player1.bid(used_cards)
        player2_bid = player2.bid(used_cards)
        winner_bid = reveal_bid(player1, player2, round_num, player1_bid, player2_bid)

        print(f"{player2.name} wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Now, the `determine_winner` function accepts `player1` and `player2` as arguments, allowing it to access these objects within the function and resolve the error.

Person:

- Welcome to the Diamond Bidding Game!
Player 1, it's your turn to bid.
Your hand: [(8, 'Spades'), (9, 'Spades'), (2, 'Spades'), (11, 'Spades'), (7, 'Spades'), (6, 'Spades'), (12, 'Spades'), (10, 'Spades'), (13, 'Spades'), (4, 'Spades'), (14, 'Spades'), (3, 'Spades'), (5, 'Spades')]

Enter the value of the card you want to bid:

There are few lack in this code:

1. it not showing the diamond card which is bid, like for first round it should show Ace(14 points).
2.after every round it should reveal the winner of current round, also calculating total points till now of both player behind the scene according to which the winner will be decided at the end of the game
3.make the game between player and computer

ChatGPT:

- I can help address those issues and modify the game to include a computer player. Let's start by displaying the Diamond card for each round and showing the winner of each round along with the current total points for both players.

Additionally, I'll add a computer player (`Player 2`) that will make random bids. Here's the updated code:

This code now includes the following improvements:

1. Displays the Diamond card for each round.
2. Reveals the winner of each round and calculates the total points for both players.
3. Adds a computer player (`Player 2`) that makes random bids.

NameError: name 'round_num' is not defined

ChatGPT:

- The error is occurring because the `round_num` variable is not defined within the `determine_winner` function. To resolve this issue, you can pass the `round_num` as an argument to the `determine_winner` function. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import random

        score_player2 += diamond_card // 2
        print("Round ends in a tie.")

    return score_player1, score_player2

def main():

    total_score_player2 = 0
    used_cards = []

    for round_num in range(1, 14):

        print(f"Current total scores - {player1.name}: {total_score_player1}, {player2.name}: {total_score_player2}\\n")

    print("Game over! Final scores:")
    print(f"{player1.name}: {total_score_player1} points")
    print(f"{player2.name}: {total_score_player2} points")
    if total_score_player1 > total_score_player2:
        print(f"{player1.name} wins!")
    elif total_score_player2 > total_score_player1:
        print(f"{player2.name} wins!")
    else:
        print("It's a tie!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Now the code should run without errors, and the `round_num` variable will be correctly passed to the `determine_winner` function.

Here computer or any player is able to bid one card twice which is wrong. One player can only bid each card only one from their respective suit, they can't repeat cards

ChatGPT:

- To ensure that a player can only bid each card from their hand once, you can modify the `Player` class to keep track of the cards that have been used for bidding. Here's the updated code with this modification:

```python

```

Now, each player can only bid each card once from their respective suits.

Person:

- Congratulations, you got the accurate code!

ChatGPT:

- I'm glad to hear that! If you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with, feel free to ask. Enjoy playing the Diamond Bidding Game!

Person:

- now next task is that we have to make a diamond game frontend using pygame, in which ui features are :
1. card you are bidding
2. a row of cards in bottom displaying all the cards you currently have in hand for bidding
3. scoreboard showing score for each round and total score after every round
4. computer bid after my bid

ChatGPT:

- Creating a frontend for the Diamond Bidding Game using Pygame involves several steps. Here's a basic outline of how you can implement the UI features you mentioned:
1. **Initialize Pygame and Setup the Window:**
- Import the necessary Pygame modules.
- Initialize Pygame and set up the display window.
1. **Load Card Images:**
- Load images for the cards in the game (Spades, Hearts, Clubs) using Pygame's `image.load()` function.
1. **Display Player's Hand:**
- Create a function to display the player's current hand of cards at the bottom of the screen.
- Use Pygame's drawing functions to display the cards in a row.
1. **Display Bidding Card:**
- Display the card the player is currently bidding on.
- Update this display as the player makes bids.
1. **Display Scoreboard:**
- Create a scoreboard to show the score for each round and the total score after each round.
- Update the scoreboard as the game progresses.
1. **Implement Computer Bidding:**
- Create a function to simulate the computer's bidding behavior.
- Update the computer's bid on the screen after the player makes a bid.

Here's a simplified example to get you started. Note that this example focuses on the basic UI elements and doesn't include the logic for the entire game. You'll need to integrate this code with your existing game logic to make it fully functional.

```python
import pygame
import random

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Constants
WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600
CARD_WIDTH, CARD_HEIGHT = 60, 90
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)

# Load Card Images
card_images = {
    'Spades': pygame.image.load('spades.png'),
    'Hearts': pygame.image.load('hearts.png'),
    'Clubs': pygame.image.load('clubs.png')
}

# Create Player Class
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name, assigned_suit):
        self.name = name
        self.assigned_suit = assigned_suit
        self.hand = []
        self.used_cards = []

    def deal_hand(self, deck):
        self.hand = [card for card in deck if card[1] == self.assigned_suit]

# Create Window
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
pygame.display.set_caption("Diamond Bidding Game")

# Font
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)

# Function to display player's hand
def display_hand(player):
    x, y = 50, HEIGHT - CARD_HEIGHT - 20
    for card in player.hand:
        suit = card[1]
        image = card_images[suit]
        screen.blit(image, (x, y))
        x += CARD_WIDTH + 10

# Function to display scoreboard
def display_scoreboard(round_num, score_player1, score_player2):
    text_player1 = font.render(f"Player 1: {score_player1} points", True, BLACK)
    text_player2 = font.render(f"Player 2: {score_player2} points", True, BLACK)
    text_round = font.render(f"Round: {round_num}", True, BLACK)
    screen.blit(text_player1, (20, 20))
    screen.blit(text_player2, (20, 60))
    screen.blit(text_round, (WIDTH - 150, 20))

# Main Function
def main():
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()
    running = True

    # Game Variables
    round_num = 1
    score_player1 = 0
    score_player2 = 0
    deck = [(value, suit) for value in range(2, 15) for suit in ['Spades', 'Hearts', 'Clubs']]
    random.shuffle(deck)
    player1 = Player("Player 1", "Spades")
    player2 = Player("Computer", "Hearts")
    player1.deal_hand(deck)
    player2.deal_hand(deck)

    while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False

        screen.fill(WHITE)

        # Display Player's Hand
        display_hand(player1)

        # Display Bidding Card
        bidding_card = deck[round_num - 1]
        suit = bidding_card[1]
        image = card_images[suit]
        screen.blit(image, (WIDTH // 2 - CARD_WIDTH // 2, HEIGHT // 2 - CARD_HEIGHT // 2))

        # Display Scoreboard
        display_scoreboard(round_num, score_player1, score_player2)

        pygame.display.flip()
        clock.tick(30)

    pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

In this code:

- Replace `'spades.png'`, `'hearts.png'`, and `'clubs.png'` with actual paths to your card images.
- This code displays the player's hand, the current bidding card, and a basic scoreboard. You'll need to integrate this with your game logic to handle bidding, calculate scores, and update the computer's bid.

Person:

- actually I have a single file having all the cards of all the suits, can we change the code according to that, i dont have separate file for each suit

ChatGPT:

- Sure, if you have a single file containing all the cards of all the suits, you can modify the code to load the card images from that file. Here's how you can do it:
1. First, ensure that your card images file contains all the cards of all the suits in a single image, arranged in rows or columns.
2. Modify the code to load the card images from this single file and display them accordingly.

Here's an updated version of the code using a single file for all the card images:

```python
import pygame
import random

In this code:

- Replace `'cards.png'` with the path to your single image file containing all the card images.
- The code calculates the position of each card within the single image based on its suit and value to display the correct card image.
- Adjust the `CARD_WIDTH` and `CARD_HEIGHT` constants if needed to match the dimensions of your card images in the single file.

Person:

- now i have three folders each for hearts, spades, clubs, each having card images of their respective suit from card 2 to ace all cards, now modify code such that i can include those 3 folders directly

ChatGPT:

- Certainly! If you have separate folders for each suit (hearts, spades, clubs) containing card images, you can modify the code to load the card images directly from these folders. Here's how you can do it:
1. Ensure that you have the card images for each suit in separate folders (`hearts`, `spades`, `clubs`), and each folder contains images named from "2.png" to "14.png" (representing cards from 2 to Ace).
2. Modify the code to load card images from these folders based on the card's suit and value.

Here's the updated code:

```python

```

In this code:

- The `card_images` dictionary is created to store the card images for each suit and value.
- The code loads card images from the respective folders (`hearts`, `spades`, `clubs`) based on the card's suit and value.
- Make sure that the folder structure matches the expected structure (e.g., `hearts/2.png`, `spades/3.png`, etc.).
- Adjust the folder names (`hearts`, `spades`, `clubs`) as needed to match your actual folder names.

Person:

- what will be the filename?

ChatGPT:

- In the code provided, the filename for each card image is constructed using the suit and value of the card. For example, the filename for the 2 of Hearts would be `'hearts/2.png'`, and the filename for the Ace of Spades would be `'spades/14.png'`.

Here's how the filenames are constructed in the code:

```python
for suit in suits:
    card_images[suit] = {}
    for value in range(2, 15):
        filename = f'{suit}/{value}.png'
        card_images[suit][value] = pygame.image.load(filename)

```

In this code:

- `suit` represents the current suit (e.g., 'hearts', 'spades', 'clubs').
- `value` represents the card value (ranging from 2 to 14 for 2 to Ace).
- `filename` is constructed by concatenating the suit, the forward slash '/', and the value with the `.png` extension (e.g., `'hearts/2.png'`).

Make sure your card image files are named following this pattern and placed in the respective folders (`hearts`, `spades`, `clubs`). For example:

- `hearts/2.png`
- `hearts/3.png`
- ...
- `spades/2.png`
- `spades/3.png`
- ...
- `clubs/2.png`
- `clubs/3.png`
- ...
This way, the code will load the correct card images based on their suit and value.

Person:

- actually they are saaved like 2_of_clubs.png

ChatGPT:

- If your card images are named as "2_of_clubs.png" (and similar for other cards), you can modify the filename construction in the code to match this naming convention. Here's how you can do it:

```python
for suit in suits:
    card_images[suit] = {}
    for value in range(2, 15):
        # Construct filename using '_of_' instead of '/'
        filename = f'{value}_of_{suit}.png'
        card_images[suit][value] = pygame.image.load(os.path.join(suit, filename))

```

In this updated code:

- The filename is constructed using `f'{value}_of_{suit}.png'`, which will generate filenames like "2_of_clubs.png", "3_of_clubs.png", and so on for each suit.
- `os.path.join(suit, filename)` is used to join the suit folder name with the filename to get the complete path to the card image.

Make sure your card image files are named following this pattern and placed in the respective folders (`hearts`, `spades`, `clubs`). For example:

- `hearts/2_of_hearts.png`
- `hearts/3_of_hearts.png`
- ...
- `spades/2_of_spades.png`
- `spades/3_of_spades.png`
- ...
- `clubs/2_of_clubs.png`
- `clubs/3_of_clubs.png`
- ...

With this modification, the code will load the correct card images based on their suit and value using the new naming convention.

- Here's the continuation and completion of the code:

```python
pygame.display.flip()
        clock.tick(30)  # Ensure smooth frame rate

        # Player 1's Bid
        player1_bid = player1.bid(bidding_card[0])

        # Computer's Bid
        available_cards_player2 = [card for card in player2.hand if card not in player2.used_cards]
        player2_bid = random.choice(available_cards_player2)
        player2.used_cards.append(player2_bid)

        # Reveal Bids
        reveal_bid(player1, player2, round_num, player1_bid, player2_bid, bidding_card[0])

        # Determine Winner
        if player1_bid[0] > player2_bid[0]:
            score_player1 += bidding_card[0]
            print(f"{player1.name} wins round {round_num} with {bidding_card[0]} points!")
        elif player2_bid[0] > player1_bid[0]:
            score_player2 += bidding_card[0]
            print(f"{player2.name} wins round {round_num} with {bidding_card[0]} points!")
        else:
            score_player1 += bidding_card[0] // 2
            score_player2 += bidding_card[0] // 2
            print("Round ends in a tie.")

        # Update Round Number
        round_num += 1

        # Check if all rounds are completed
        if round_num > 13:
            print("Game over! Final scores:")
            print(f"{player1.name}: {score_player1} points")
            print(f"{player2.name}: {score_player2} points")
            if score_player1 > score_player2:
                print(f"{player1.name} wins!")
            elif score_player2 > score_player1:
                print(f"{player2.name} wins!")
            else:
                print("It's a tie!")
            running = False  # End the game loop

    pygame.quit()  # Quit Pygame

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

This completion includes:

1. Handling player1's bid using the `bid` method of the `Player` class.
2. Generating computer's bid randomly from available cards using the `random.choice` function.
3. Updating the round number and checking if all rounds are completed to end the game and display final scores.
4. Ending the game loop and quitting Pygame at the end of the game.

- now its not even running

```

This code includes the correct structure for the game loop, player bidding, computer bidding, revealing bids, determining the winner, and ending the game with final scores. It should now run without errors and function as expected.
